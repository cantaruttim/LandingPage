# Landing Page
 
Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Tools:

<div style="display: inline_block"><br>
  <img align="center" alt="Canta-HTML" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg">
  <img align="center" alt="Canta-CSS" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original.svg">
  </div>
